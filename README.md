# Kenya Agricultural Production Report 1961-2021

## Overview
The agricultural sector in Kenya shows significant growth and diversity over the observed period. Production values, measured in millions (M) and billions (B) of Kenyan currency, reveal major contributions from livestock and crop-related activities.

Full Period (1961–2021):

Total Value: 5,922.90M

Count of Items: 150

Recent Period (2019–2021):

Total Value: 622.53M

Count of Items: 148

## Trends and Observations
Dominance of Livestock:

Across both full and recent periods, livestock (cattle, goats, sheep) account for the bulk of production value.

Decline in Total Value in Recent Years:

Comparing the total value in 2019–2021 (622.53M) to the full historical dataset (5,922.90M) shows a relative slowdown or reduced coverage in recent years.

Shift in Rankings:

Cattle was the top product historically but goats lead in recent years, possibly due to market demand, climate resilience, or export trends.

Crop Contributions:

Sugar cane and maize remain the main crop contributors, but their share is much smaller compared to livestock.

## Recommendations
Strengthen Livestock Value Chains: Given goats and cattle dominate, investments in breeding, veterinary services, and market access could yield high returns.

Diversify Agricultural Portfolio: Encourage high-value crops and agro-processing to reduce reliance on livestock.

Improve Data Collection: Reduce unofficial/imputed figures for more accurate planning.

Sustainability Focus: Promote climate-smart agriculture to mitigate drought and disease risks affecting livestock and crop yields.
